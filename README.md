WEB LAYOUT DESCRIPTION --
HEADER SECTION
- A header is used to contain the Name title and reachout button.
- float is used to implement the column layout for the discover bar, which has links to different sections of the page
- The first section of the page is the introduction section that has my pic along with the usage of summary and detail tag. The detail tag has my linkedin Introduction
- absolute positioning was used to achieve the image position, a slight box-shadow is used as well to give it a nice elevated effect
- projects are kept in cards. I have 3 cards per flex container and the positioning of the cards are determined with the help of flex
- menu is used as an unordered list for the project description section

REFERRAL SECTION 
- This section has the table and styling implementation as well for the tables
- th and thead was selected for the darker shade of blue
- nth even child was selected using the pseudo class to achieve the lighter background color for the second data row for the table
- the table's container's height is kept smaller intentionally to showcase the use of overflow and scroll property
- the content of the referral sections are taken from the letter of recommendations that I received from the listed individuals
- the scroll bar width has also being adjusted using css 

CERTIFICATIONS SECTION 
- Image gallery with hover effect and with the use of figure and figure caption has been created
- box-shadow, boldness, background color and a few other properties are toggled on hover.
- the certificates open in a new tab when clicked, this has been achieved with the help of target="_blank"
- the certificates are dummy certificates that I created using pages template, this was crossed checked with TA before implementation

TRAVELS
- travels section has similar card layout to the certification section
- it has videos from my recent trip to NY
- I faced a peculiar issue while implementing the video tag.
- the videos were originally in .MOV format. adding these directly resulted in the videos being 180 deg flipped.
- trying to flip it the other way using transform property resulted in the controls getting inverted.
- fixed the issue my converting the mov files to .mp4 files, will have to check the limitations of the video tag

COMMENTS SECTION
- the comment section makes use of the form tag
- the form tag has a textarea field and a submit button that is present to take feedback

FOOTER SECTION 
- The footer section has the mailto link and audio tag
- The audio tag has the audio file of the GTA V loading screen, which, in my humble opinion, makes for a better viewing experience.
- I created a voice memo from a yt video for the same, since this website will not see the light of day, there won't be any copyright issues

IPAD IMPLEMENTATION 
- the column layout was abandoned for the ipad layout and instead absolute positioning was used again for the nav links
- the header gets a background color as well
- sections like project container and certification were added separately with different layout to reduce the number of cards for the ipad layout
- the ipad layout has 2 project cards and 2 certificate cards per row.
- this was achieved by setting the 3 card container to display:none in the media query styles
- column layout was used for the travel section

MOBILE IMPLEMENTATION 
- Navigation was removed since the heading of the page as getting cluttered
- image size was reduced and border radius was increased - for the author image
- the reachout text was also removed and now we only have the icon left
- flex direction for all flex containers were changed to column to fit the smaller screen better

RESOURCES 
- colors for the website were selected from - https://yeun.github.io/open-color/#teal and - https://flatuicolors.com/palette/defo
- favicon was taken from a collection on - https://www.drawkit.com/
