name - Anant Kumar LNU
NUID - 002050375

Going of the similar structure that I followed for the first assignment, I'll list out the core requirements and where they are covered in the assignment:
Favicon - https://www.drawkit.com/illustrations/chubbs-character-illustrations an image from this collection was cropped and used for the favicon as it kind of matches the color tone of the website

Table - 
Form
Images - author image and maybe illustrations about work from the work from home collection 
Hyperlink - in the nav
Button - reachout button 
audio - 'recommended soundtrack for viewing the page '
video - recent trips section -- same border radius things and 
header - the page has an header, explanation of implementation is below 
footer - the page has an footer, explanation of implementation is below 
summary - the intro portion below the image is written in the summary tag  
menu - cards will have list 
tel for contact information - reachout button 
mailto for contact information - in the footer
Use an external CSS file only. - have done
Use of float and overflow property - overflow also not done .. will set a height limit and then add to make scroll bar for the table section 
Use of column layout structure -  need to ask 
Use of absolute and relative position whenever necessary - done
Add a table, then style the table using CSS selectors. Guide for CSS Selectors - http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.aspLinks to an external site. - done
Create a professional image gallery for certifications, etc., with hover effects and figure captions. Include this in your portfolio. - need to ask
Make the website responsive using media queries for devices like iPad(768px) and Smart phones (350 – 365px). For example, below pic is a sample (scroll down 2nd page) - will do
There is more weightage on the responsiveness of the page and media query implementation. Fail to implement will be reflected in the grading.
Include the readme.txt/readme.md file and include all the tags used and give a short description - in the thing so done 
The assignment must be submitted on your PRIVATE GitHub account (use Northeastern email account). The zip file must be submitted on CANVAS, and the GitHub URL of the assignment must be in the canvas remarks. - will be done


for the web --- 3 cards in a row for the projects 

for the tab -- 2 per row 




for mobile 
1 per row 
the anant kumar on the right becomes centered and the nav items below the anant kumar
everything goes single file 
footer also everything goes in a column 


Remaining tasks—
Travel videos and 4 in row for web 
2 in row for iPad
1 after the other for mobile
Give hover effect with the use of box shadows in pseudo classes
give box shadow to all smaller boxes 

Video tags inside of the figure and then fig captions for the video 

Need to think about the following 
 float, --  will float some illustrations on the projects section 
 column layout … maybe move the navigation to the left as a bar and then the header becomes a container with the same clour as the background and then name will be lighter color and the name and the button will have box shadow 


 questions to ask-

 have no cdrtifications .. can i have a play at videos for the figure and fig caption requirements

 go for dummy certificates

 what is required for the column layout .. is it the 2 part thing where the left of the page has the navigation 

 have the audio file paly by default with minimal volume and have controls in the footer
